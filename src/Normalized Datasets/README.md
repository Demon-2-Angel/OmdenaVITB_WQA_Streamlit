RGB Function- Dissolved oxygen matter and Suspended matter


RGB Values : DOM and SM
The code is processing Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) satellite data to derive two important water quality parameters: dissolved organic matter (DOM) and suspended matter (SM). The RGB image is created by selecting the Oa08 (near-infrared), Oa06 (green), and Oa04 (blue) bands from the satellite data, and taking their median value. This is done using the select() and median() functions of the ImageCollection object.
The multiplication factor ee.Image([0.00876539, 0.0123538, 0.0115198]) is used to convert the raw radiance values from the satellite data to reflectance values. Reflectance is a measure of the amount of light reflected by a surface, and is a more useful metric for analyzing the properties of the water in this case. The multiplication factor is applied to the RGB image using the multiply() function of the Image object.
Finally, the resulting image is clipped to the region defined by vectors, which is a geometry object that represents the region of interest for this analysis. Clipping the image ensures that only the relevant pixels are used for further analysis, which can help to reduce processing time and improve the accuracy of the results. This is done using the clip() function of the Image object.
The resulting rgb image is then used to derive two important water quality parameters: dissolved organic matter (DOM) and suspended matter (SM). These are calculated by dividing the Oa08 band by the Oa04 band to derive the DOM index (dom), and by dividing the Oa08 band by the Oa06 band to derive the SM index (suspended_matter). These indices can provide information about the amount and type of organic and inorganic matter present in the water, which can be useful for monitoring water quality and detecting environmental changes over time.










Rgb :can help in finding this things 
❖	Suspended solids: These are small, solid particles that are suspended in the water column, such as clay, silt, and sand particles.
❖	Nutrients: Inorganic nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are essential for the growth of aquatic plants and algae. However, excessive amounts of these nutrients can cause harmful algal blooms and other water quality problems.
❖	Metals: Many inorganic metals, such as iron, manganese, and copper, are naturally occurring in water and can be present in high concentrations in some areas. Other metals, like lead and mercury, can enter water sources through industrial pollution and other human activities.
❖	Salts and minerals: Inorganic salts and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and sodium are also commonly found in water. These compounds can have an impact on water quality and can affect the suitability of the water for different uses, such as irrigation or drinking water.
