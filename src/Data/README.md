To detect the presence of lakes within urban areas, several spectral indices can be used depending on the characteristics of the lake and the surrounding urban landscape. Some of the commonly used indices are:

1) *Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI):* This index is sensitive to the presence of water bodies and has been used to map water bodies in urban areas.

2) *Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI):* This index is similar to NDWI but uses green and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands instead of blue and SWIR bands. MNDWI has been shown to perform well in detecting water in urban areas with vegetation.

3) *Urban Water Index (UWI):* This index is specifically designed to detect small water bodies in urban areas and is based on the differences between red, green, and SWIR bands.

4) *Water-Modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (WMNDVI):* This index uses both red and near-infrared bands to distinguish between water and vegetation in urban areas.
These indices can be calculated from multispectral satellite or aerial imagery and can be used to map and monitor the extent and changes of lakes within urban areas.
NOTE - The accuracy of the lake detection can be influenced by various factors, such as cloud cover, shadow, and urban infrastructure, and may require further analysis and validation.
